                        <h2>Biography</h2>
                        <p>He is the Shaykh and ʿAllāmah, ʿUbayd bin ʿAbd Allāh bin Sulaymān al-Jābirī al-Hamadānī, and Banū Jābir is among the tribes of Ḥarb of the Ḥijāz.</p>
                        
                        <p>He was born in the town of al-Faqīr in al-Farʿ valley in the region of Madīnah in 1357 AH (1938). At the age of eight, he moved with his father to Mahd al-Dhahab, where he acquired the first stages of his education. His father moved there in order to work. He remained in education at this location for eight years. After that, he returned to al-Farʿ valley. Then in 1376 AH (1956) he settled in Madīnah and, due to family circumstances, was unable to study for a period of time.</p>
                        
                        <p>Then in the year 1381 AH (1961), he resumed his studies, starting with Dār al-Ḥadīth al-Madaniyyah. Then he joined al-Maʿhad al-ʿIlmī and stayed there for five years. He got married before joining the Faculty of Sharīʿah in the Islamic University of Madīnah in 1388 AH (1968). He graduated four years later in 1392 AH (1972), excelling in his grade.</p>
                        
                        <p>After that, he was an imām in Masjid al-Sabt in Madīnah between 1387-1392 AH. Then he was a teacher at ʿUmar bin ʿAbd al-ʿAziz Intermediate School in Jeddah from 1392 AH to 1396 AH. After that, the Shaykh worked as a caller for Markaz al-Daʿwah wal-Irshād, assisting the director of the centre, Shaykh ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz bin Bāz, in his presence and acting on his behalf in his absence from the end of 1396 AH to 1404 AH (1976-1983).</p>
                        
                        <p>Then he was a teacher at the Islāmic University between the end of 1407 AH to 1414 AH. During his presence there, he also attained a Masters in the subject of tafsīr. After a few years serving at the Community Service Centre affiliated with the Islāmic University, the Shaykh then retired in 1417 AH (1996).</p>
                        
                        <p>After this the Shaykh continued his lectures and lessons, with students from the Islāmic University frequenting his home and benefiting from his knowledge, advice and wisdom. During this period, the Shaykh also aided the Salafi daʿwah tremendously, particularly in the West by way of fatherly advice, clarifications, admonitions and refutations of the people of falsehood and their false innovated principles. The Shaykh had a very strong relationship with the students of knowledge from Maktabah Salafiyyah, Birmingham.</p>
                        
                        <p>The Shaykh has many beneficial works in the field of ʿaqīdah, manhaj, and fiqh.</p>
                        
                        <p>The Shaykh (may Allāh have mercy on him) passed away at the age of 84 on 28 Rabīʿ al-Thānī 1444 AH, corresponding to 22 November 2022. May Allāh shower him with mercy and reward him greatly for his service to Islām, the Muslims and the Salafī daʿwah.</p>
