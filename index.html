                                    Prince Rogers Nelson (1958-2016) was an American singer, songwriter, musician, record producer, dancer, actor, and filmmaker. A guitar virtuoso and multi-instrumentalist known for his eclectic work, flamboyant stage presence, extravagant fashion sense, and use of makeup, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest musicians of his generation. His music incorporated a wide variety of styles, including funk, R&B, rock, new wave, soul, synth-pop, pop, jazz, and hip hop. Prince produced his albums himself, pioneering the Minneapolis sound.

He signed a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records at the age of 19, and released his debut album 'For You' in 1978. His 1979 album 'Prince' went platinum, and his next three records—'Dirty Mind' (1980), 'Controversy' (1981), and '1999' (1982)—continued his success, showcasing his prominently sexual lyrics and blending of funk, dance, and rock music.

                                    Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (1918-2013) was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary, political leader, and philanthropist who served as the first president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election. His government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid by tackling institutionalised racism and fostering racial reconciliation. Ideologically an African nationalist and socialist, he served as the president of the African National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997. A Xhosa, Mandela was born into the Thembu royal family in Mvezo, British South Africa. He studied law at the University of Fort Hare and the University of the Witwatersrand before working as a lawyer in Johannesburg. There he became involved in anti-colonial and African nationalist politics, joining the ANC in 1943 and co-founding its Youth League in 1944. After the National Party's white-only government established apartheid, a system of racial segregation that privileged whites, he and the ANC committed themselves to its overthrow.

Jobs was born in San Francisco to a Syrian political science professor and a graduate student who gave him up for adoption. He was raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. He attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year, and traveled through India in 1974 seeking enlightenment and studying Zen Buddhism. In 1976, he co-founded Apple with Steve Wozniak to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers.

                                    Michael Joseph Jackson (1958-2009) was an American singer, songwriter, and dancer. Dubbed the 'King of Pop', he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. Over a four-decade career, his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture. Jackson influenced artists across many music genres; through stage and video performances, he popularized complicated dance moves such as the moonwalk, to which he gave the name, as well as the robot. He is the most awarded music artist in history. The eighth child of the Jackson family, Michael made his professional debut in 1964 with his elder brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5 (later known as the Jacksons). Jackson began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records, and rose to solo stardom with his fifth studio album 'Off the Wall' (1979). His music videos, including those for 'Beat It', 'Billie Jean', and 'Thriller' from his 1982 album 'Thriller', are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an artform and promotional tool.

                                    John R. Cash (1932-2003) was an American singer, songwriter, musician, and actor. Much of Cash's music contained themes of sorrow, moral tribulation, and redemption, especially in the later stages of his career. He was known for his deep, calm bass-baritone voice, the distinctive sound of his Tennessee Three backing band characterized by train-like chugging guitar rhythms, a rebelliousness coupled with an increasingly somber and humble demeanor, free prison concerts, and a trademark all-black stage wardrobe which earned him the nickname the 'Man in Black'. Born to poor cotton farmers in Kingsland, Arkansas, Cash rose to fame during the mid-1950s in the burgeoning rockabilly scene in Memphis, Tennessee, after serving four years in the United States Air Force. Cash was first discovered by Sam Phillips, the founder of Sun Records, after approaching Phillips wanting to record gospel music. Phillips was not interested in gospel and suggested Cash come back with some secular music. Cash returned with 'Hey Porter', and Phillips immediately saw his potential.

Through his angst-fueled songwriting and anti-establishment persona, Cobain came to be regarded as the spokesman of Generation X and is considered one of the most influential musicians in the history of alternative rock. He was heralded as a spokesman of Generation X and is considered one of the most influential musicians in the history of alternative rock. Born in Aberdeen, Washington, Cobain formed the band Nirvana with Krist Novoselic and Aaron Burckhard in 1987 and established it as part of the Seattle music scene which later became known as grunge. After signing with major label DGC Records, Nirvana found global success with 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' from their critically acclaimed second album 'Nevermind' (1991). Although Cobain was hailed as the voice of his generation following Nirvana's sudden success, he resented the attention and placed his focus on the band's music, believing the band's message and artistic vision to be more important than his celebrity status.
